/**
 * Applies supabase/migrations/*.sql to a real database.
 *
 * Until now these files were pasted into the Supabase SQL editor by hand, in
 * filename order, by somebody remembering which ones they had already run.
 * That works exactly until it doesn't: the failure mode is a half-applied
 * migration on production at the moment you are least able to think clearly.
 *
 * What this gives you instead:
 *
 *  - **A ledger.** `public.schema_migrations` records every file applied, when,
 *    and by whom. Running twice is a no-op rather than a set of errors you have
 *    to read carefully to confirm are harmless.
 *  - **Checksums.** A migration that has already been applied and has since
 *    been *edited* is refused. Editing an applied migration means staging and
 *    production silently disagree about what the schema is, and nothing else
 *    would ever tell you.
 *  - **One at a time.** A session-level advisory lock, so two people deploying
 *    at once queue instead of interleaving.
 *  - **All or nothing, per file.** Each migration runs inside a transaction
 *    with its own ledger row, so a failure leaves that file unapplied rather
 *    than half-applied. (Postgres has transactional DDL; this is the one real
 *    advantage it has over most databases and it is worth using.)
 *  - **Production says its name.** `--env production` refuses to proceed unless
 *    you also pass `--yes`, and prints what it is about to do first.
 *  - **A reset that cannot reach production.** `--reset` drops `public` and
 *    re-applies every migration from 0001, which is the fastest way to find out
 *    whether the whole stack still builds from nothing. It runs against staging
 *    and only staging: no flag widens it, and it checks the URL as well as the
 *    name, because the name is just a label on an environment variable.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run migrate:status                    # what's applied where
 *   npm run migrate -- --env staging          # apply everything pending
 *   npm run migrate -- --env staging --dry-run
 *   npm run migrate -- --env production --yes
 *   npm run migrate -- --env staging --to 0016_full_sync_coverage.sql
 *   npm run migrate:reset                     # staging only: drop it all, re-apply from 0001
 *
 * Connection strings come from the environment and are never read from .env
 * files that Expo inlines into the app bundle — a database URL carries the
 * password for a role that bypasses row-level security, and it must not end up
 * in a build:
 *   SUPABASE_DB_URL_STAGING     postgres://...
 *   SUPABASE_DB_URL_PRODUCTION  postgres://...

/**
 * A reset is a drop and a rebuild of `public`, plus the privileges Supabase
 * creates that schema with.
 *
 * `cascade` reaches outside the schema, which is the point: 0001's
 * `on_auth_user_created` trigger lives on `auth.users` and depends on
 * `public.handle_new_user()`, so it goes when the function does — and 0001 can
 * then create it again. Without cascade the drop simply refuses.
 *
 * The grants matter as much as the drop. PostgREST reaches everything as
 * `anon` / `authenticated` / `service_role`, and a freshly created `public`
 * grants them nothing at all. Skip this and you get a database that is
 * structurally perfect and completely unreachable: every request from the app
 * fails with "permission denied for schema public", and nothing in that message
 * points back at this command.
 *
 * `alter default privileges` rather than `grant on all tables`, because at this
 * moment there are no tables — the ones that matter are created by the
 * migrations that run next.
 *
 * Two deliberate departures from Supabase's own template: it grants `create` on
 * `public` to `anon` and `authenticated` as well, which is a quirk worth not
 * reproducing, and roles are granted only if they exist, so this also works
 * against a plain Postgres that has never heard of Supabase.
 *
 * The ledger is inside `public` and goes with it, which is what makes the
 * re-apply that follows a full one rather than a no-op.
