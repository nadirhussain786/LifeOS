-- 0021_user_blocks.sql
--
-- Blocking somebody, as a user rather than as an operator.
--
-- ## Why this exists
--
-- 0010 through 0019 built the operator side of moderation: reports, staff
-- tiers, account blocks, audit. All of it runs through somebody at LifeOS
-- deciding something. There was nothing a user could do about another user in
-- the moment, which is both the thing that actually helps and the thing Google
-- Play's user-generated-content policy and App Store 1.2 require: an app whose
-- users can reach each other must let them report content AND block the person.
--
-- ## What blocking has to stop, here
--
-- The one surface where a stranger reaches you is a shared expense group. The
-- sequence is: they add your email as a placeholder member, then send an
-- invitation, which emails you and deep-links into the app. That invitation is
-- the contact. Everything downstream of accepting it — the group name, the
-- expense descriptions, the activity feed — is content they can write and you
-- can read.
--
-- So a block has to bite at three points, not one:
--
--   1. Adding your email to a group, which is where the placeholder is created.
--   2. Creating the invitation, which is the message that actually reaches you.
--   3. Accepting one, because an invitation created before the block still has
--      a live token, and a token is bearer authority — nothing else would stop
--      it being redeemed later.
--
-- Points 1 and 2 are triggers rather than checks inside the RPCs, because a
-- member row is inserted directly under RLS (see addMemberByEmail) and an RPC
-- check would only cover the path that happens to go through an RPC today.
--
-- ## Symmetric, deliberately
--
-- A block stops contact in both directions, not just theirs toward you. The
-- asymmetric version reads as more precise and produces an obvious hole: you
-- block somebody, then add them to a group yourself, and now you are in a
-- shared space with them again — with content they can write. If you want to
-- reach them, unblock them.
--
-- ## What it does NOT do
--
-- It does not remove either of you from a group you are already both in. That
-- would either delete a membership row the ledger depends on (0008 exists
-- because filtering members out of the balances made £75 vanish from a £100
-- dinner) or silently change what everybody else in the group is owed. Leaving
-- the group is the existing action for that, and it is the honest one. The UI
-- says this rather than implying a block retroactively separates you.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The table
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Both columns cascade, so a deleted account takes its blocks with it in either
-- direction — this table has no `user_id` column, so 0020's catalog checks do
-- not cover it and the constraints below are the whole guarantee. The SQL
-- suite asserts both directions.

create table if not exists public.user_blocks (
  blocker_id uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  blocked_id uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade,
  created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
  primary key (blocker_id, blocked_id),
  constraint user_blocks_not_self check (blocker_id <> blocked_id)
);

-- The lookup is "is there a block in either direction between these two", which
-- is two index probes; the primary key serves one and this serves the other.
create index if not exists user_blocks_blocked_idx on public.user_blocks (blocked_id);

alter table public.user_blocks enable row level security;

-- You may see, create and remove the blocks YOU made. There is deliberately no
-- policy granting `blocked_id = auth.uid()`: being able to read who blocked you
-- turns the feature against the person using it. Somebody who can enumerate
-- their blockers knows exactly who to reach on another account, and the reason
-- most people block somebody is that they do not want that person to know.
create policy "user_blocks_own" on public.user_blocks
  for all using (blocker_id = (select auth.uid()))
  with check (blocker_id = (select auth.uid()));

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The predicate
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER because it has to see blocks in the direction the policy
-- above hides: the whole point is to answer "has this person blocked me"
-- without letting the caller read that fact. It returns a boolean and nothing
-- else, so the answer cannot be mined for who — only for whether, about a pair
-- the caller is already party to.

-- ## On the wording of the refusal
--
-- The message names neither the block nor the person. "Blocked you" would
-- confirm the block to the one person it is meant to be opaque to, and someone
-- who learns they are blocked is exactly the someone who opens a second
-- account. A silent success is the other tempting option and is worse: the
-- inviter watches for a member who never appears and tries again, and the app
-- has lied about what it did.
--
-- So: a true statement that does not say why. This person cannot be added.
-- It is also true of several other states, which is the property that makes it
-- safe.
