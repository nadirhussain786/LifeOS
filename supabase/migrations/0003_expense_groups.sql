-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Shared expense groups (split expenses with friends / colleagues / family)
--
-- This is the first *shared* data in LifeOS. Every table in 0001 is governed by
-- a `*_own` policy (user_id = auth.uid()), so a row belongs to exactly one
-- person. A split group is the opposite: many people read and write the same
-- rows, and access is decided by membership rather than ownership.
--
-- Conventions follow 0001 so the sync engine sees a familiar shape: text ids
-- generated client-side (local-first), bigint epoch-ms timestamps, money in
-- integer cents, and soft deletes via deleted_at.
--
-- Two columns from 0001 are deliberately absent: sync_status and
-- server_updated_at. Those are per-device bookkeeping about *your* copy of a
-- row you own; on a row shared by five people they are meaningless and would be
-- clobbered by whoever synced last. Shared tables need their own sync path.
--
-- File order matters: LANGUAGE SQL bodies are parsed and validated at CREATE
-- time, so every table must exist before the helper functions that read them,
-- and the helpers must exist before the policies that call them. Tables →
-- indexes → helpers → RLS → triggers.
