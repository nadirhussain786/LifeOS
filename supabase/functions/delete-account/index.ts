// Supabase Edge Function: delete-account
//
// Permanently deletes the calling user's account and all their synced rows.
// The client (features/auth/services/auth-store.ts → deleteAccount) invokes
// this; the client CANNOT call auth.admin.deleteUser, so it must run here with
// the service-role key. Required for App Store 5.1.1(v) / Google Play
// account-deletion compliance and GDPR Art. 17.
//
// Deploy:
//   supabase functions deploy delete-account
// The SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY are injected automatically by
// the Supabase runtime; no manual secrets needed.
//
// Requires migration 0020 to have been applied. It refuses to run otherwise,
// loudly — see below.
//
// This file is Deno (URL imports) and is excluded from the app's tsconfig.
//
// ## Why there is no list of tables here any more
//
// There was one, of 15 names, while sync covered 38. It had been correct when
// it was written and was never revised as 0009 and 0016 added history and media
// tables, so deleting an account left behind every water log, the gallery and
// music libraries, all habit/goal/journal/note history, `private_entries`
// (cycle and intimacy records) and `vault_escrow` (the sealed private-space
// key). None of it was recoverable afterwards either: with the auth user gone
// and every policy keyed on `user_id = auth.uid()`, the rows answer to nobody.
//
// A list in this file is the wrong shape for the job. It has to be revised by
// whoever adds a table, months later, in a different language, in a directory
// the migration does not touch — and being wrong produces no error, no failed
// deploy and no failing test, only data that quietly outlives the person who
// asked for it to be gone.
//
// So the table list lives in the schema now: 0020 gives every per-user table
// `references auth.users(id) on delete cascade`, and deleting the auth user
// deletes the data in the same transaction. What is left here is the part a
// foreign key cannot do — checking that the guarantee is present before relying
// on it, and confirming afterwards that it held.
