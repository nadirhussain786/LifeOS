 * Public environment for the app. Deliberately lenient: missing/blank Supabase
 * creds must NOT crash the app — LifeOS is offline-first and fully usable in
 * guest mode with no backend at all. Auth and sync check `isSupabaseConfigured`
 * and stay disabled (guest-only) until real values are present.
 *
 * EXPO_PUBLIC_ vars are inlined by Metro at build time. For local dev they come
 * from `.env`; for an EAS build they come from the EAS environment that eas.json
 * links the build profile to — and app.config.js now fails a release build
 * outright when the required ones are absent, rather than letting a
 * credential-less APK ship silently. The anon key is safe to expose client-side:
 * it only grants what your Row Level Security policies allow.
 *
 * Note that `process.env` must be indexed with a literal here. Metro's inlining
 * is a compile-time text substitution, so a computed key like `process.env[name]`
 * resolves to nothing at runtime.
