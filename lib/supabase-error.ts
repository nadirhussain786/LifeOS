/**
 * Turns a Supabase failure into something a person can act on.
 *
 * Every server-backed call used to end at `throw new Error(error.message)`, and
 * every screen rendered the same sentence for whatever came back: "check your
 * connection and try again". That sentence was wrong far more often than it was
 * right. A missing RPC, an expired session and a row-level-security refusal all
 * look identical to the user, and all of them point at the network — the one
 * thing that was working. The Split module made this concrete: a group-creation
 * bug (see supabase/migrations/0007) surfaced as a connection error, so the only
 * suggested remedy was the only one that could never help.
 *
 * `code` is what makes the distinction possible, so it has to survive the throw
 * — hence SupabaseError rather than a bare Error. `kind` is then the small,
 * closed set the UI actually branches on, and each kind maps to copy that names
 * a cause and a next step.
