 * LifeOS Design Tokens — the single source of truth for the native side.

 * Philosophy: a Spatial Design System. Calm, spacious, premium. Depth comes
 * from layered surfaces + soft elevation, never from neomorphic bevels or
 * skeuomorphic texture. Chrome stays near-grayscale (with a whisper of the
 * emerald accent bias in the neutrals so nothing reads as "unconsidered gray").
 * Color is spent deliberately: one brand accent, one signature tint per life
 * module, and a strictly separate semantic (success/warning/error/info) system.
 *
 * Where you can use a NativeWind className, prefer it (bg-background,
 * text-muted-foreground, rounded-lg, …) — those resolve from global.css /
 * tailwind.config.js which mirror these values. Reach for this module only
 * where classNames can't: StatusBar, navigation theme objects, SVG charts,
 * Reanimated worklets, expo-linear-gradient stops, native shadow objects.
 *
 * See lib/color.ts for tint → gradient/glow derivation helpers used with the
 * per-module `MODULE_TINTS` below.
