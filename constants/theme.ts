 * Raw color values for the places a NativeWind className can't reach — native
 * components (StatusBar, RefreshControl), navigation theme objects, SVG charts,
 * Reanimated worklets, gradient stops. Everywhere else, prefer the Tailwind
 * tokens (bg-background, text-foreground, …).
 *
 * These are now DERIVED from constants/design-tokens.ts rather than being a
 * second, hand-maintained copy of the palette. They had drifted: this file said
 * the light background was #ffffff and the dark one #121212, while
 * design-tokens (and global.css, which the classNames actually resolve from)
 * said #f8fbf9 and #0e1210. 137 files import this one and 65 import the other,
 * so most screens were drawing native chrome from one palette and Tailwind
 * chrome from the other — a mismatch that shows up as a faint seam wherever a
 * hand-colored icon or sheet backdrop sits on a class-colored surface.
 *
 * Keeping the old key names means nothing had to be rewritten to fix it. New
 * code should import from design-tokens directly; this shape is the bridge, not
 * a second system.
