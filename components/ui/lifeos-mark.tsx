/**
 * The LifeOS mark.
 *
 * Six blades leaving a hexagonal opening — a shutter mid-turn. It is the only
 * mark in the set whose negative space does the work, which is what keeps it
 * legible at 48px in a settings row, and it reads as a lens on a life rather
 * than a letter in a box.
 *
 * The geometry matches `MARKS.aperture` in `scripts/make-brand-assets.mjs`
 * exactly: one blade authored upright, then placed six times at 60° intervals.
 * The generator rotates the sample point by -a; SVG rotates the shape by +a,
 * which is the same thing. The viewBox is the mark's measured ink bounding box
 * so it self-centres at any size.
 *
 * Keeping the two in step matters — the launcher icon, the native splash and
 * this component are the three places a user meets the brand, and a mark that
 * drifts between them reads as three different apps. That script also holds
 * eleven alternates; changing which one ships means updating both files.
