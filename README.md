# LifeOS

A local-first personal life operating system — tasks, habits, journal, money,
health and memories in one app. Your data lives on your phone. It leaves only if
you create an account and switch sync on, module by module.

Built with Expo (React Native), SQLite on the device, and Supabase (Postgres +
Row Level Security) as the optional backend.

> **Status: pre-release.** The code typechecks, lints, and passes 246 unit tests
> plus 159 assertions against a real Postgres. **None of it has been observed
> running on a physical device**, and no Supabase project has been created yet.
> Notifications and widgets cannot run in Expo Go at all — they need a dev
> build. See [Known limitations](#known-limitations) before trusting anything
> here.

## What it is

Most life apps are a cloud service with an app attached: the data is theirs, the
device is a window onto it, and losing signal means losing the app. LifeOS is the
other way round.

- **Local-first.** Every write goes to on-device SQLite first. The app is fully
  functional with no account, no network, and no server — that is the normal
  mode, not a degraded one.
- **Sync is opt-in, per module.** You choose an account, then choose which
  modules upload. A module left switched off is never sent anywhere.
- **Guest mode is real.** You can use the entire app without an account. If you
  later sign up, local data migrates to your user id automatically rather than
  starting you over.
- **Honest about what it can see.** Anything the operator can technically read is
  stated in [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and in the app itself, rather than being
  implied away. See [Security and privacy](#security-and-privacy).

## Modules

Four daily drivers sit in the tab bar with a launcher — **Today**, **Tasks**,
**Habits**, **Journal**, and the **Hub**. Everything else lives in the Hub,
grouped:

| Group         | Module   | What it does                                                       |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Growth**    | Goals    | Goals with milestones and progress logs                            |
|               | Study    | Study sessions and subject tracking                                |
|               | Notes    | Notes with categories, tags, attachments and `[[wiki-links]]`      |
|               | Timeline | A chronological view across everything you have recorded           |
| **Wellbeing** | Sleep    | Sleep sessions and quality                                         |
|               | Water    | Water intake logging against a daily target                        |
| **Finance**   | Budget   | Transactions, debts and savings, in integer cents                  |
|               | Split    | Shared expense groups, invitations, balances and settlements       |
| **Memories**  | Gallery  | Photo/video albums, including progression ("story") views          |
|               | Music    | Local audio library, playlists and a player                        |
| **System**    | Settings | Theme, language, notifications, sync, app lock, data export/import |

Plus, behind a PIN and separate encryption, a **private space**: Vault, Cycle,
Recovery and Us. Its data is encrypted field-by-field on the device.

Cross-cutting: reminders and a notification inbox with quiet hours and a smart
digest, an Android home-screen widget, search across modules, a dashboard, four
languages (English, Arabic, Hindi, Urdu) with RTL layout, light and dark themes,
and biometric app lock.

## Architecture

```
app/                    Expo Router routes — screens only, no business logic
  (tabs)/               Today, Tasks, Habits, Journal, Hub
  (auth)/ (onboarding)/ Sign-in, sign-up, reset, first-run
features/<module>/      One folder per feature, consistently layered:
  components/           Presentational pieces for that feature
  hooks/                React Query hooks — the only thing screens call
  services/             Repositories and pure logic (the testable half)
  store/                Zustand stores for UI/session state
  types/                Types for the feature
database/               Drizzle schema, bootstrap DDL, client
lib/                    Cross-cutting: i18n, supabase, dates, money, errors
components/ constants/  Shared primitives and design tokens
supabase/migrations/    Numbered SQL migrations, 0001 → 0019
scripts/                Migration runner, SQL test harness, build tooling
docs/                   Operations, design system, SQLCipher notes
```

Three rules hold the layering together:

1. **Screens never touch the database.** They call hooks; hooks call
   repositories; repositories own the SQL. This is why the logic that matters is
   testable without rendering anything.
2. **Money is integer cents, never floats.** Formatting is locale-aware via
   `Intl.NumberFormat`, including zero-decimal currencies.
3. **Timestamps are epoch milliseconds** everywhere — device and server — so the
   sync engine can move rows without per-column mapping.

### How sync works

The engine in [`features/sync/services/sync-engine.ts`](features/sync/services/sync-engine.ts)
pushes local changes and pulls remote ones on launch, on foreground, and on
demand. Points worth knowing:

- **Last-write-wins**, on `updated_at`. Deletes are soft (`deleted_at`) and bump
  `updated_at`, because a hard delete leaves nothing to sync and the row simply
  comes back from another device.
- **Cursors are `(updated_at, id)` pairs.** A bare timestamp cursor cannot
  advance past a page of rows sharing one millisecond, and those rows become
  permanently invisible.
- **Both directions paginate.** PostgREST caps a response at 1000 rows whatever
  you ask for; treating that as "everything" means a large account syncs one page
  per launch.
- **13 syncable modules** covering every local table except `notification_log`,
  which is this phone's record of what it scheduled and is meaningless elsewhere.
- **Media syncs as rows, not bytes.** Albums, playlists, captions and ordering
  travel; the photo, video and audio files stay on the device that imported them
  and appear elsewhere as "Not on this device".

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node 24+.** Required by the test suite: `database/schema.test.ts` executes
  the app's real bootstrap DDL through `node:sqlite`.
- npm, and the Expo CLI via `npx`.
- Optionally a Supabase project. Without one the app still runs — in guest mode.

### Install and run

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env       # fill in Supabase values, or leave them for guest mode
npm start                  # then press a / i, or scan the QR code
```

`npm run android` / `npm run ios` / `npm run web` start on a specific target.

> **Expo Go is not enough for everything.** Notifications, widgets, secure
> storage and biometrics need a development build:
> `eas build -p android --profile development`.

### Environment

Every variable is documented in [.env.example](.env.example). The short version:

| Variable                              | Required | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`            | For auth | Supabase project URL                          |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`       | For auth | Anon key — safe client-side; RLS is the guard |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL`   | No       | Password-reset deep link override             |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN`              | No       | Crash reporting; blank keeps errors local     |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_VAULT_ESCROW_PUBLIC_KEY` | No       | **Enables operator access to private spaces** |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL_STAGING`             | Migrate  | **Shell only — never `.env`**                 |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL_PRODUCTION`          | Migrate  | **Shell only — never `.env`**                 |

The two database URLs are the one pair that must never go in `.env`: Expo inlines
that file into the app bundle, and a Postgres URL carries the password for a role
that bypasses Row Level Security entirely. Export them in your shell or a CI
secret store.

---

## The two databases

**On the device.** SQLite, created by `database/bootstrap.ts` on first launch:
tables, additive columns for older installs, backfills, then indexes — in that
order, because a column added with a default leaves existing rows at that default
and `updated_at` at a default is invisible to sync forever.

**On the server.** Postgres, defined by the 19 numbered migrations in
[`supabase/migrations/`](supabase/migrations/). Every table has Row Level
Security; a user reaches only their own rows, and the policies — not the client —
are what enforce it.

### Running migrations

```bash
npm run migrate:status                              # what is applied where
npm run migrate -- --env staging --dry-run          # what would run
npm run migrate:staging                             # apply pending
npm run migrate:production                          # prompts before touching anything
npm run migrate -- --env staging --to 0016_full_sync_coverage.sql
npm run migrate:reset                               # staging only: drop it all, re-apply from 0001
```

The runner keeps a `schema_migrations` ledger with checksums, takes an advisory
lock so two deploys queue rather than interleave, and wraps each file in a
transaction with its ledger row. It **refuses to run when an applied migration
has been edited** — re-running an edited `create ... if not exists` file usually
succeeds while changing nothing, which looks like success and leaves your two
databases quietly different. Put the change in a new migration.

`--reset` rebuilds staging from empty, which is the only way to find out whether
the schema still builds as a sequence. It cannot reach production: there is no
override flag, and it compares the two URLs as well as the environment name.
Full detail in [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md).

---

## Testing

```bash
npm test              # 246 unit tests
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint          # eslint
npm run test:sql      # 159 assertions against real Postgres (PGlite, no Docker)
npm run check:migrations
```

Two suites, deliberately different in kind:

- **`npm test`** covers the pure logic where a bug silently corrupts data —
  money, habit streaks, sync table contracts, cycle and recovery math, vault
  crypto, the password policy, the migration planner — plus the SQLite bootstrap,
  executed rather than merely read.
- **`npm run test:sql`** applies every migration to a WASM Postgres and asserts
  that Row Level Security actually refuses what it should. Every policy assertion
  runs as `authenticated`, because Postgres exempts superusers from RLS and an
  assertion made on the default connection passes without proving anything.

CI runs all of the above on push and pull request.

## Scripts

| Script                              | Does                                    |

## Building

EAS profiles are defined in [eas.json](eas.json):

| Profile          | Output                        | Use                                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `development`    | APK with dev client           | Device testing; credentials optional |
| `preview`        | Internal APK                  | Sharing a build                      |
| `production`     | Store build, auto-incremented | Release                              |
| `production-apk` | Internal APK of production    | Sideloading a release build          |

```bash
eas build -p android --profile development
```

A local `.env` is **not** uploaded to EAS — each profile pulls variables from the
EAS environment it links to (`eas env:create --environment production ...`).
[app.config.js](app.config.js) fails a preview or production build outright when
the Supabase credentials are missing, because the bundler treats an unset
`EXPO_PUBLIC_` variable as an empty string: the build would otherwise succeed and
produce an app that installs fine and cannot sign anybody in.

---

## Security and privacy

- **Row Level Security on every server table.** The client is not trusted; the
  policies are the enforcement. A blocked account is denied reads and writes at
  the database, not by a screen a modified client could skip.
- **The session lives in the OS keystore** (`lib/secure-session-storage.ts`),
  chunked, because a refresh token is a bearer credential for the account and
  AsyncStorage is an unencrypted file in the app sandbox.
- **PKCE** for auth, so a password-reset deep link carries a single-use code
  rather than the tokens themselves.
- **Password policy** following NIST SP 800-63B — length over composition rules.
  It is a client-side check and therefore advisory; the server-side floor is a
  Supabase project setting that still needs raising.
- **App lock** via biometrics/device credential, and a **private space** behind a
  separate PIN with field-level encryption.
- **Moderation** is documented, audited, and bounded: staff can reach an account
  only while a live report names it, admins can reach anything, and every access
  writes an audit row _before_ the data is produced.

> **LifeOS is not end-to-end encrypted when a build carries
> `EXPO_PUBLIC_VAULT_ESCROW_PUBLIC_KEY`.** With that key set, every private
> space's master key is also sealed to the operator key and uploaded, so staff
> can open any signed-in user's private data for abuse handling. This is a
> deliberate product decision, the app says so on screen before a PIN is chosen,
> and leaving the variable empty keeps the app end-to-end encrypted. See
> [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Conventions

- **TypeScript `strict`**, effectively no `any` and no `@ts-ignore`.
- **Comments explain _why_, not what.** The interesting comments in this codebase
  record the failure that motivated the code — keep that habit; it is the reason
  the tricky parts are followable a year later.
- **Conventional commits** (`feat(sync)!:`, `fix(auth):`), with a body that
  explains the reasoning rather than restating the diff.
- **Migrations are append-only.** Never edit an applied one; add the next number.
- Run `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test && npm run test:sql` before
  opening a pull request. CI runs exactly that.

---

## Known limitations

Stated plainly, because each of these is the kind of thing a README usually
implies away:

- **Nothing has been validated on a physical device.** No notification has been
  observed firing, no widget rendering, no sign-in completing on hardware.
- **No Supabase project exists yet.** The migration runner supports staging and
  production; neither database has been created, so nothing has been applied
  anywhere real.
- **Migration 0016 is breaking for old clients.** It drops columns older builds
  still push. Apply it with a client release, not ahead of one.
- **Media files never leave the device.** Only their metadata syncs. Uploading
  bytes needs Storage buckets, per-user quotas and a resumable queue.
- **The local device wipe needs a cooperating client.** A modified build can
  decline to run it; the server-side denial cannot be declined.
- **Appeals have no route back in.** A blocked user cannot export their own data,
  so a data-access request is served by an admin running SQL by hand.
- **The bundle identifier is still `com.lifeos.app`,** a placeholder to replace
  before any store submission.
