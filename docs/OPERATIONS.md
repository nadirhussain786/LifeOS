# Operations — migrations, roles, and moderation

Two things live here: how schema changes reach a database, and what an operator
can actually do to an account. They are in one document because the second is
enforced entirely by the first.

---

## 1. Databases

Two Supabase projects, not two schemas in one project.

| Environment  | Variable                     | What it is for                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `staging`    | `SUPABASE_DB_URL_STAGING`    | Where a migration is run for the first time, always. |
| `production` | `SUPABASE_DB_URL_PRODUCTION` | Real accounts.                                       |

Separate projects rather than separate schemas, because the point of staging is
that a mistake there costs nothing — and that is only true when the mistake
cannot reach production's tables through a search-path slip or a
`security definer` function that forgot to pin one.

Both URLs come from **the shell or a CI secret store, never `.env`**. Expo
inlines `.env` into the app bundle, and these carry the password for a role that
bypasses row-level security. `.env.example` explains this where you would
otherwise be tempted to fill them in.

Use the **session pooler (port 5432)**, not the transaction pooler (6543): the
runner holds an advisory lock across statements and wraps each migration in an
explicit transaction, and the transaction pooler supports neither.

---

## 2. Running migrations

```bash
npm run migrate:status                        # what is applied where
npm run migrate -- --env staging --dry-run    # what would run
npm run migrate:staging                       # apply
npm run migrate:production                    # prompts before touching anything
npm run migrate -- --env staging --to 0016_full_sync_coverage.sql
```

The runner keeps a ledger in `public.schema_migrations` (filename, checksum,
when, by whom), takes a session advisory lock so two deploys queue instead of
interleaving, and runs each file inside a transaction together with its ledger
row — so a failure leaves that migration unapplied rather than half-applied.

**It refuses to run if an already-applied migration has been edited.** This is
the check worth understanding: editing an applied migration does not change the
database that already ran it, so staging and production quietly stop being the
same schema. Re-running it is not a fix either — these files are mostly
`create ... if not exists`, so a re-run of an edited file often succeeds while
doing nothing, which looks like success. Put the change in a **new** migration.

The order is always: **staging → verify → production.** `npm run test:sql`
applies every migration to a throwaway WASM Postgres and asserts the policies
refuse what they should; it runs in CI, and it is not a substitute for staging.

### Rebuilding staging from nothing

```bash
npm run migrate:reset                            # prompts, then drops and re-applies all of it
npm run migrate -- --env staging --reset --dry-run   # what it would destroy, destroying nothing
npm run migrate -- --env staging --reset --yes       # unattended (CI)
```

This drops `schema public` and applies every migration from 0001 in order. It is
the only way to find out whether the schema still builds from empty — a stack of
migrations that each worked when applied can still fail as a sequence, and
nothing else in the repo runs them against a real server in order.

**It will not touch production.** Not with `--yes`, not with any flag: there
isn't one. `--env production --reset` is refused before a connection is opened.
It also compares `SUPABASE_DB_URL_STAGING` against `SUPABASE_DB_URL_PRODUCTION`
and refuses if they match, because the environment name is a label on a variable
and the variable is what actually gets dialled — pasting production's URL into
the staging one for a quick query is a normal thing to do and a bad thing to
still be true an hour later.

What survives: **`auth.users`**, which lives outside `public`. Everybody can
still sign in, to an empty account — 0007's backfill gives them their profile row
back, and nothing else comes back. What is restored alongside the schema are the
grants and default privileges for `anon` / `authenticated` / `service_role`;
without them the rebuilt database is structurally perfect and returns "permission
denied for schema public" to every request the app makes.

### Deploying 0016 specifically

0016 drops columns that older app builds still push (`reminder_notification_id`,
`sync_status`, `server_updated_at`). Apply it **with** a client release, not
ahead of one — a stale client's sync will fail loudly against the new schema.

---

## 3. Operator roles

`public.admins` has a `role` column.

| Role    | Can reach                                        | Gate                                    |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `staff` | One account's profile and the reports against it | **Only while a live report names them** |
| `admin` | Any account, any row, deleted rows included      | None, beyond a stated reason            |

Both tiers additionally require a registered origin (`admin_allowed_origins`,
migration 0014). A staff account on an unregistered network is not staff.

**Every call is audited** to `admin_audit_log`, _before_ the data is produced —
so a query that errors halfway still records that somebody looked. Staff access
additionally records **which report justified it**, so a later review reads
"opened account X because of report Y" rather than "opened account X".

Add an operator:

```sql
insert into public.admins (user_id, role, note)
values ('<uuid>', 'staff', 'moderation, hired 2026-08');
```

Existing rows default to `admin`, so a deploy does not demote the owner out of
their own console.

### What "live report" means

`staff_access_report()` grants access when a report against that account is
`open`, or was `actioned` within the last 30 days. A **dismissed** report grants
nothing from the moment it is dismissed — staff looked, found nothing, and the
reason to keep looking is gone. The 30-day tail exists because work does not
stop at the verdict: appeals arrive, and a moderator has to be able to check
their own decision.

### Staff surface

```sql
select * from public.operator_report_queue(100);                    -- the queue
select * from public.operator_user_profile('<uuid>', 'report r-12'); -- one account
select * from public.operator_user_reports('<uuid>', 'report r-12'); -- its reports
```

`operator_user_reports` never returns `reporter_id`. Telling the reported
party's moderator who complained is one leak away from telling the reported
party, and retaliation against reporters is what stops people reporting at all.

### Admin surface

```sql
-- Any table, any user, soft-deleted rows included. No password, no PIN.
select * from public.admin_user_rows('<uuid>', 'journal_entries', 'report r-12', true, 500);

-- Private-space ciphertext, plus the escrow key to open it offline (0015).
select * from public.admin_fetch_private_entries('<uuid>', 'report r-12', 500);
select * from public.admin_fetch_vault_escrow('<uuid>', 'report r-12');
```

`admin_user_rows` takes the table name against a **whitelist**
(`operator_readable_tables()`). Without one, a function that selects from any
name an admin types is a function that will happily read `auth.users`.

---

## 4. Blocking an account

```sql
-- Block, allow 15 minutes for the device to upload what it has, then wipe it.
select public.admin_block_user('<uuid>', 'sustained harassment, report r-12', null, true, 15);

-- Active abuse: cut off immediately, no evacuation window.
select public.admin_block_user('<uuid>', 'CSAM referral, report r-31', null, true, 0);

select public.admin_unblock_user('<uuid>', 'appeal upheld');
```

What a block does:

1. **Server access stops.** Migration 0019 gates every synced table's policy —
   reads _and_ writes — on `may_access_own_data()`. This is the only real
   enforcement; the app-side block screen is UX that a modified client ignores.
2. **The device wipes itself.** A `wipe_local` row is queued in
   `device_commands`; the app picks it up on launch and on each foreground.
3. **Their data survives in production**, so an unblock restores it.

### The evacuation window, and what it costs

Those three are in tension: wipe the device, keep the data, and a blocked
account may not upload. The resolution is `evacuation_until` — a short window
during which the account can still reach _its own_ rows, so the device gets one
final push before wiping. It is not a loophole: what a block cuts off is reach
into _other people's_ surfaces, and that is `can_share()` (0010), which this does
not touch.

**Modules the user had sync switched OFF were never uploaded and are lost.** An
evacuation does not override that setting — consent to upload is not something a
block should retroactively revoke. The app names those modules on the block
screen before it wipes, and the device reports them back in `ack_detail` so an
operator handling an appeal knows what is actually gone.

`p_evacuation_minutes => 0` skips the window entirely. That makes the wipe
unrecoverable for anything not already synced. It is the right call for active
abuse and it is a decision, not a default.

### Checking whether a wipe actually happened

```sql
select user_id, issued_at, acked_at, ack_detail
  from public.device_commands
 where command = 'wipe_local' order by issued_at desc;
```

`acked_at is null` means the device never came back — off, uninstalled, or
factory reset. That is materially different from a wipe that ran, and "the
account is blocked" alone cannot tell you which.

Unblocking cancels any outstanding wipe, so a phone that was off through the
whole episode does not wake up and empty an account that is fine again.

### Purging content

```sql
select public.admin_purge_user_data('<uuid>', 'confirmed abuse, report r-12');
```

**Soft** delete — sets `deleted_at`, which is also what the sync engine reads as
a tombstone, so the purge propagates to every device that syncs. The rows stay
for an appeal, for a legal hold, and for the case where the block turns out to
be wrong. A hard delete would destroy the evidence the report was about along
with the ability to reverse a mistake.

---

## 5. Limits worth knowing

- **The local wipe needs a cooperating client.** A modified build can decline to
  run it. The server-side denial cannot be declined; the wipe can. No amount of
  app-side code fixes this.
- **This is not end-to-end encrypted.** It stopped being so at 0015. `PRIVACY.md`
  says so, and the store data-safety form has to as well.
- **Nothing here has been exercised against a real Supabase project or on
  hardware.** `npm run test:sql` proves the policies behave against WASM
  Postgres; `npm test` covers the client sequencing. Neither is a device.
