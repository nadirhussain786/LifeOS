/**
 * The order of operations in an operator-ordered wipe.
 *
 * Almost all of this service is I/O, and mocking I/O to assert that it was
 * called is usually a test that proves nothing. These four are the exception,
 * because each one is a sequencing rule whose violation is silent and expensive:
 *
 *   - acknowledging a wipe that did not happen tells the operator a device is
 *     clean when it is not, and stops the retry;
 *   - wiping before pushing destroys the data the push existed to preserve;
 *   - reporting an empty loss list when the push failed understates the damage
 *     to somebody who is about to appeal;
 *   - and running any of it for an account in good standing is a catastrophe.
