/**
 * Blocking another user.
 *
 * The operator-side moderation built in 0010–0019 all routes through somebody
 * at LifeOS deciding something, which is the right shape for adjudication and
 * the wrong shape for the moment you actually want it. This is the part a user
 * can do themselves, immediately, without explaining themselves to anybody.
 *
 * Enforcement is entirely server-side (migration 0021). That matters more here
 * than usual: the person a block is aimed at is by definition motivated, and a
 * check that lives in the client is a check they can remove by building their
 * own. The three doors — being added to a group, being invited, and a token
 * minted before the block — are shut by triggers and by
 * accept_group_invitation, so the app below is only ever a way to ask.
 *
 * What blocking does NOT do is remove either party from a group they are
 * already both in. Deleting a membership row breaks the ledger it anchors (see
 * migration 0008, where filtering members out of the balances lost £75 from a
 * £100 dinner), and silently changing what other people are owed is not a thing
 * a block should do. Leaving the group is the action for that, and the UI says
 * so rather than implying otherwise.
