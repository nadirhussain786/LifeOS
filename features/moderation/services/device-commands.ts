/**
 * Instructions the operator has left for this account's devices.
 *
 * Today there is one: `wipe_local`, issued when an account is blocked. The
 * device fetches it on launch and on each foreground, carries it out, and
 * acknowledges it — the acknowledgement is the point as much as the wipe is,
 * because "blocked" alone cannot tell an operator whether a phone ever came
 * back to receive the instruction.
 *
 * ## This is not the enforcement
 *
 * A modified client can decline to run any of this. What actually stops a
 * blocked account is migration 0019's row-level security, which refuses every
 * read and every write server-side regardless of what the app does. This
 * removes the *local* copy, which the server cannot reach on its own — and it
 * only works on a cooperating client, which is a real limitation and not one
 * any amount of app-side code can fix.
