/**
 * That the safety features are actually reachable.
 *
 * This exists because of the specific way they were missing. `submitReport` and
 * its whole server side had been written, reviewed and migrated — 0013 —  and
 * no screen ever called it. Nothing failed: the typecheck passed, the tests
 * passed, the RPC was deployable. The app simply had a complete abuse pipeline
 * with no opening, and the only way to notice was to go looking for the caller.
 *
 * `SecureContentView` was the same shape: an `onReport` prop, no call site.
 *
 * Reporting and blocking are also the two things Google Play's user-generated
 * content policy and App Store 1.2 require of an app whose users can reach each
 * other, so "it exists but nothing calls it" is a review rejection as well as a
 * gap. A dead safety feature is worse than an absent one — it reads as done.
 *
 * Read as source text: these screens pull in expo-router, reanimated and the
 * bottom sheet, none of which render under Jest. The question is which module
 * calls which, and that is answerable statically.
