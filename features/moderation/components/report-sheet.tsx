/**
 * Reporting something somebody else wrote.
 *
 * `submitReport` and its server side (0013) have existed since the reports
 * migration and nothing ever called them, which meant the app had a complete
 * abuse pipeline and no way for a user to put anything into it. Both stores
 * require this for an app where users can reach each other, and more to the
 * point, a group whose only response to an abusive expense description is
 * "leave the group" is not one you would want somebody you know using.
 *
 * ## The evidence
 *
 * The report carries the item complained about, because the operator has no
 * other way to see it — for shared content there is nothing readable
 * server-side, and even for an expense group, reading somebody's group to
 * investigate is a far bigger intrusion than reading the one line they
 * objected to. The caller passes exactly that one item, and the copy says so
 * before the report is sent rather than after.
 *
 * The reporter is never shown to the reported party (0013's policies), which is
 * why this sheet does not warn about retaliation: there is nothing to warn
 * about, and saying "they won't be told it was you" is how you plant the idea
 * that they might be.
