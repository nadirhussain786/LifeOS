/**
 * Routes between first-run onboarding, the auth flow, and the app.
 *
 * Order of gates: **unonboarded → onboarding** (whether or not there is a
 * session); then unauthenticated → login; then the app. Waits for both the
 * session check and the persisted profile so the first frame never flashes the
 * wrong screen. Mounted once from the root layout.
 *
 * The first two gates used to be the other way round, which put a sign-in form
 * in front of every new user before the app had shown it did anything. The
 * account offer now lives inside onboarding, one step past the welcome, so this
 * gate must let an unauthenticated visitor *into* onboarding — which is the whole
 * reason the order changed.
 *
 * Onboarding is deliberately allowed to send people into `(auth)` while it runs
 * ("use email instead", "already have an account"). That is why the redirect out
 * of `(auth)` is conditional on being onboarded: bouncing them straight back
 * would make those two links dead.
