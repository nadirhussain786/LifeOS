/**
 * What LifeOS will accept as a password.
 *
 * Supabase's default floor is six characters of anything, which in practice
 * means `123456` guards a journal, a cycle tracker and a private space. This is
 * the app's own floor, applied before the request goes out so the person gets a
 * specific reason rather than a generic server rejection.
 *
 * The rules follow NIST SP 800-63B rather than the older "one upper, one digit,
 * one symbol" pattern: length is what actually resists guessing, and composition
 * rules mostly produce `Password1!`. So the requirements are a real minimum
 * length and a check against the passwords attackers try first.
 *
 * This is a client-side check and therefore advisory — it improves the choice a
 * person makes, it does not stop a crafted request. The server-side floor is
 * Supabase's own `password_min_length` / `password_required_characters` project
 * settings, which should be raised to match (see docs/SECURITY.md).
