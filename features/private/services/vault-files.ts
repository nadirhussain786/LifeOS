/**
 * Encrypted-at-rest file storage for the vault.
 *
 * The Progress Gallery copies picked media into the app's document directory as
 * plain files (see features/gallery/services/gallery-storage.ts). That is fine
 * for a photo of a plant. It is not fine here, so this differs in four ways,
 * each closing a specific way the old approach leaks:
 *
 *  - **Bytes are sealed** under the vault key. The file on disk is
 *    indistinguishable from noise without it.
 *  - **Names are random and extensionless.** `IMG_4471.jpg` in a directory
 *    listing tells a story before anything is opened; `a3f1…` does not.
 *  - **The directory carries `.nomedia`**, so Android's media scanner does not
 *    index it and the OS gallery never shows a thumbnail of vault content.
 *  - **Thumbnails are encrypted too.** An encrypted original next to a
 *    plaintext preview protects nothing.
 *
 * Decryption is to memory (a data URI), never to a temp file. A decrypted copy
 * on disk outlives the lock and is exactly the artefact this feature exists to
 * avoid.
