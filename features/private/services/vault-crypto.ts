/**
 * The private space's cryptography, and nothing above it.
 *
 * Key hierarchy, which is the part worth understanding:
 *
 *   PIN ──pbkdf2──▶ KEK ──AES-GCM──▶ (wrapped VMK)
 *                                          │
 *                                       unwraps
 *                                          ▼
 *                                         VMK ──AES-GCM──▶ rows, files
 *
 * The Vault Master Key (VMK) is random and never derived from the PIN. That
 * indirection is what makes changing the PIN a re-wrap of 32 bytes instead of
 * re-encrypting every photo, and it is what lets a *second* PIN unwrap a
 * *different* VMK — which is the whole mechanism behind the decoy space.
 *
 * ⚠️  NOT end-to-end encrypted as shipped. When the build carries an operator
 * escrow key, the VMK is ALSO wrapped to that key and uploaded, so the operator
 * can open any private space — see vault-escrow.ts and migration 0015. The
 * crypto below is unchanged and still protects the data at rest and from other
 * users; what it no longer does is exclude the operator.
 *
 * Pure JS on purpose (@noble). It works in a dev client and in Expo Go with no
 * native rebuild, so the vault is real today rather than after a build that
 * `expo export` cannot verify. The cost is speed: see PBKDF2_ITERATIONS.
 */

/**
 * 120k, which is below the OWASP floor for PBKDF2-SHA256, and the reasoning
 * matters more than the number.
 *
 * Stretching cannot rescue a short PIN: at 210k a six-digit PIN still falls in
 * hours to anyone holding the wrapped key, and the honest conclusion is that
 * iteration count is not what protects this. What protects it is that the
 * wrapped key lives in SecureStore — the hardware keystore — so an attacker
 * with the app's files and no device passcode never obtains the blob to attack
 * in the first place (see vault-keys.ts), plus the attempt throttling there.
 *
 * So this is set where it is genuinely useful — real defence in depth if the
 * keystore is ever defeated — without spending four seconds of a real person's
 * time on every unlock. In pure JS on a mid-range phone this lands near a
 * second; `pbkdf2Async` yields between blocks so the UI keeps painting.
