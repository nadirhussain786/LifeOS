/**
 * Setting up, opening and changing the private space's keys.
 *
 * Everything persisted here goes to SecureStore rather than AsyncStorage, and
 * that is the load-bearing decision. AsyncStorage is a plaintext file: it rides
 * along in an ADB backup and is readable on a rooted device, which would hand
 * an attacker the wrapped key to grind offline at their leisure. SecureStore
 * keeps it in the iOS Keychain / Android Keystore behind the device passcode,
 * so the offline attack does not start.
 *
 * ⚠️  A copy of the master key may also be escrowed to the operator — see
 * vault-escrow.ts. Nothing in this file uploads anything, but "the key never
 * leaves the device" stopped being true the moment escrow was configured, and
 * a reader of this file should not be left believing otherwise.
 *
 * Two spaces, one mechanism
 * -------------------------
 * A real PIN and a decoy PIN each wrap a *different* random master key. Both
 * wrapped blobs sit side by side and are indistinguishable — uniform random
 * bytes of identical length. Unlocking tries each in turn and takes whichever
 * opens.
 *
 * This is why the decoy holds up: it is not a UI that hides rows. Content
 * written in the real space is encrypted under the real key and genuinely
 * cannot be opened with the decoy key, so a decoy unlock shows an empty space
 * because the space *is* empty, and nothing on the device says otherwise.
 * Anything written while in decoy mode is real data in the decoy space, which
 * is what makes it look lived-in rather than staged.
