/**
 * Blocks screenshots, screen recording and the app-switcher preview while a
 * private screen is mounted.
 *
 * Worth being precise about what this buys. It does not stop a determined
 * attacker — nothing stops a second phone pointed at the screen. It stops the
 * *accidental* disclosures that actually happen to people: a screenshot landing
 * in the camera roll and from there in an auto-backup or a shared album, a
 * screen recording left running, and a legible thumbnail of the vault sitting
 * in the app switcher for whoever picks the phone up next.
 *
 * On Android this is `FLAG_SECURE`, which covers the switcher as a side effect.
 * On iOS the capture block needs iOS 13+, and the switcher needs its own call —
 * hence the extra line, which is a no-op elsewhere.
 *
 * Failures are swallowed on purpose: an OS that refuses the flag should cost
 * the flag, not the screen the user opened.
