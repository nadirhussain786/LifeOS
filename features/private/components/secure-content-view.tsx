/**
 * The viewer for content somebody else shared with you.
 *
 * What it actually enforces, and what it cannot
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Enforced: screenshots and screen recording are blocked, there is no save
 * button, no share sheet, and no long-press menu; the viewer's own name is
 * watermarked across the content; the owner can revoke access server-side.
 *
 * Not enforced, and impossible to enforce: somebody photographing the screen
 * with a second phone. No app on any platform prevents that — the pixels have
 * to reach a human eye, and a camera can be pointed at the same place.
 *
 * That limit is why the watermark is here and why it carries the viewer's name
 * rather than a decorative logo. It cannot stop a photograph; it makes a
 * photograph traceable to whoever took it, which is the deterrent that actually
 * works between people who know each other. The notice below says all of this
 * to the viewer, in plain words, because the person deciding whether to share
 * something intimate deserves an accurate model of what they are getting.
