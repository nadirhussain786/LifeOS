/**
 * Offline-first sync engine.
 *
 * The local DB is always single-user (`user_id = 'local'`); the engine swaps
 * `'local' ↔ the authenticated uid` at the Supabase boundary, so a guest's
 * existing rows upload to their account automatically on first sync (no
 * migration pass). Conflict resolution is last-write-wins by `updated_at`.
 * See features/sync/config/sync-tables.ts for which tables participate.
 *
 * ## Why the cursors are pairs, not timestamps
 *
 * Change detection is a high-water mark per table, and it used to be the plain
 * `max(updated_at)` seen so far, with each run fetching `updated_at > cursor`.
 * That is correct only while no two rows share a timestamp — and `updated_at`
 * is milliseconds, written by loops that insert many rows inside the same
 * millisecond (a habit backfill, an import, the initial upload of an existing
 * account). Once more rows share one millisecond than fit in a page, the
 * pagination cannot advance: the next request asks for `> cursor` and skips
 * every remaining row at exactly `cursor`. Those rows are then invisible to
 * sync permanently — no error, no retry, they simply never travel.
 *
 * So the cursor is the pair `(updated_at, key)` and the predicate is the
 * lexicographic "greater than that pair". Ties are broken by a column that is
 * unique by construction, so every row has exactly one position in the order
 * and the walk always terminates.
 *
 * ## Why pages exist at all
 *
 * PostgREST caps a response at its configured maximum (1000 rows by default)
 * whether or not you ask it to. The previous code took whatever came back as
 * "everything that changed", so an account with more than a page of history
 * silently synced one page per app launch. Both directions now loop until a
 * short page proves the end was reached.
 */
