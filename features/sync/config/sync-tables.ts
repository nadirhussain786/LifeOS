/**
 * Registry driving the sync engine and the per-module allow-sync toggles.
 *
 * ## What a table needs to be here
 *
 * A text key column (`id` for almost everything), a `user_id`, and an
 * `updated_at` — the engine's change-detection key. Anything the user can
 * remove also needs `deleted_at`: without it a removal cannot propagate, the
 * server keeps the row, and the next pull resurrects it on the device that
 * deleted it. The contract test in ./sync-contract.test.ts holds this line,
 * because a table missing one of these does not error — it just silently never
 * syncs, or syncs wrongly.
 *
 * ## History
 *
 * v1 synced only each module's **primary records** — your habits, your goals,
 * your subjects — and none of the history, so signing in on a second device
 * gave you your habits back with every streak at zero. 0009 added the history
 * tables. This revision adds everything that was left: tags, wiki-links,
 * per-module settings, routine and playlist membership, and media metadata.
 * The only local table that still does not sync is `notification_log`, which is
 * the device's own record of notifications it scheduled — bookkeeping about
 * this phone, not content the user wrote.
 *
 * ## Media, and what "synced" means for it
 *
 * Gallery, music and attachments sync their **rows**, not their **bytes**.
 * Albums, playlists, captions, favourites, ordering and membership all reach
 * the second device; the files themselves stay where they were imported. A
 * pulled media row has an empty `uri` and the UI shows it as not on this
 * device (see SYNC_DEVICE_LOCAL_COLUMNS and `remote_path`, which is where an
 * upload would record itself).
 *
 * The previous design excluded these tables entirely, on the reasoning that a
 * row without its file is a broken reference. That is true only if nothing
 * marks it as absent — and the cost of the exclusion was that a new phone
 * showed an empty gallery with no indication that anything had ever been in it.
 * An entry that says "not on this device" is strictly more information than no
 * entry at all.
 *
 * `sensitive` modules default to sync OFF and stay local unless the user turns
 * them on.

 *    storage. Another device's path resolves to nothing here, so the row would
 *    render as a broken image rather than as absent media.
 *
 * `sync_status` and `server_updated_at` are per-device sync bookkeeping; they
