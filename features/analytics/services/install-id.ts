 * under-report by however many people never make one — and the honest fix is a
 * number that is joinable to no account, no device identifier and no content.
 * A v4 UUID minted here satisfies that: it is meaningless off this device.
 *
 * In SecureStore rather than AsyncStorage so it does not travel in a device
 * backup, and cached in memory because the reporter asks for it on every
