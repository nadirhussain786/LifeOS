 * The shield around a study focus block: while it's up, nothing LifeOS controls

 *
 * What it does, and where each piece lives:
 *
 *  - Music pauses (features/music/services/player-controller).
 *  - LifeOS reminders are swallowed instead of shown. The foreground handler in
 *    lib/notifications checks the focus flag and holds them; they are already
 *    rows in the in-app inbox, and everything held is re-announced as a single
 *    summary the moment the block ends, so no reminder is lost — only deferred.
 *
 * Keeping the screen awake is not here: it belongs to the timer screen being on
 * screen rather than to the focus phase, so app/study/timer.tsx holds that wake
 * lock via expo-keep-awake's `useKeepAwake` for as long as it's mounted.
 *
 * What this deliberately does NOT do: silence the phone itself. See
 * {@link canOpenSystemDoNotDisturb} — that is not something an app can do.
