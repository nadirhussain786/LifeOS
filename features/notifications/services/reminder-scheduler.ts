/**
 * Rebuilds every reminder the app owns, from scratch.
 *
 * ## Why this has to exist
 *
 * Until now a reminder was scheduled exactly once — at the moment its item was
 * saved — and never revisited. But `scheduleOneTimeNotification` /
 * `scheduleDailyNotification` return `null`, and the owning row then stores
 * `reminderNotificationId = null`, in *all* of these cases:
 *
 *   - notification permission has not been granted yet
 *   - the reminder's category is switched off
 *   - delivery mode is "smart digest" (every non-urgent category is folded in)
 *   - the master switch is off
 *   - the computed time has already passed
 *
 * None of them is permanent, and none of them was ever retried. So a user who
 * created ten tasks and then granted permission had ten reminders that would
 * never fire; turning a category off and on again destroyed its reminders for
 * good; and the master toggle called `cancelAllScheduled()` on the way out with
 * nothing to undo it on the way back in. The code said as much in a comment —
 * "reminders return as each item is re-saved" — which is not something a user
 * can be expected to know, or to do for every item they own.
 *
 * Restoring a backup had the same shape: the restored rows carry notification
 * ids belonging to an install that no longer exists, and nothing rescheduled.
 *
 * ## How
 *
 * Cancel everything, then rebuild from the database. That is deliberately a
 * full rebuild rather than a diff: the OS queue and the app's stored ids can
 * disagree in both directions (ids pointing at nothing after a reinstall,
 * queued notifications whose item was deleted while the app was closed), and a
 * rebuild is the only cheap operation that is correct from every starting
 * state. It is idempotent, so running it on every launch is safe.
 *
 * ## What it will not do
 *
 * Prompt. A resync runs unattended — on launch, after a settings change — and
 * a permission dialog that appears with no user action behind it gets refused,
 * which is worse than not asking. So it checks permission first and returns
 * early, and the settings screen calls it again once permission is granted.
